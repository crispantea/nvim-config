This is my Neovim configuration.

## Requirements

Before cloning and using this configuration, make sure you have:

- Added an alias to your shell configuration (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) if needed.
- `ripgrep` installed (`rg` command is required for some plugins and search functionality).
- `xclip` installed for system clipboard support.
